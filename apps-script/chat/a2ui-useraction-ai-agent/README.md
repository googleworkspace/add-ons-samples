# Google Chat A2UI AI agent with user action as Google Workspace add-on

Chat app that integrates with an A2UI-wrapped ADK AI agent with user action
hosted in Vertex AI Agent Engine.

You can deploy this sample by following the instructions in the quickstart [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/chat/quickstart-a2ui-agent). Make sure to use this version of the ADK agent and Chat app implementation instead of the one used for the quickstart.
